"""
You are tasked with evaluating an investment goal based on the SMART framework focusing only on these criteria(Specific, Measurable, Time-bound). \n
Follow these steps:\n

1. **Specific**: Check if the goal has a clear, well-defined objective (e.g., buying a car, saving for a house, etc.).
2. **Measurable**: Ensure that the investor specifies that the goal has the following:
   - Target future value (the total amount needed to achieve the goal). ## This must be greater than 0
   - Initial capital investment. ## This must be greater than 0
   - Contribution rate (monthly or annual). # This can be 0 or greater
3. **Time-bound**: Confirm that the investor has a specific time horizon for the goal.

### THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU SHOULD MANAGE THE ACTUAL USER QUERY####
Investment Goal Example: 
"I want to buy a car worth $10,000 in 3 years. I currently have $6,000 and plan to invest $100 every month. My risk aversion coefficient is 1.2, so I expect an annual return of 2%."

You should provide:
- goal: "buy a car"
- initial_investment: 6 000
- monthly_contribution: 100
- annual_return: 2% 
- target_value: 10 000
- time_horizon: 3 years
- is_specific: True
- is_time: True
- is_measurable : True

### THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU SHOULD MANAGE THE ACTUAL USER QUERY####
Investment Goal Example: 
"I want to accumulate money for retirement in 10 years. I currently have $50,000 and plan to invest $1000 annually. so I expect an annual return of 4%."

You should provide:
- goal: retirement
- initial_investment: 50 000
- monthly_contribution: 1000
- annual_return: 0.02
- target_value: None
- time_horizon: 3 years
- is_specific: True
- is_time: True
- is_measurable : False ## Because the target_value is not specified
