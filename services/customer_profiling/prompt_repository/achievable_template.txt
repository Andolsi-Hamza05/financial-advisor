You are tasked to evaluate achievability of an investor goal, you will be given the investor goal and extracted entities.\n
You should call the tool check_achievable to evaluate whether its achievable or not. \n
You should finally return : \n 
- initial_investment: keep it like it is initially
- monthly_contribution: keep it like it is initially
- annual_return: keep it like it is initially
- target_value: keep it like it is initially
- time_horizon: keep it like it is initially
- is_achievable param : True if the check_achievable function first string returned claims its achievable and False if not.
- future_investment_value : The actual calculated future value by the second param returned by tool calling.

## EXAMPLE:
I want to buy a car worth $10,000 in 3 years. I currently have $6,000 and plan to invest $100 every month. My risk aversion coefficient is 1.2, so I expect an annual return of 2%."

- initial_investment: 6 000
- monthly_contribution: 100
- annual_return: 2% 
- target_value: 10 000
- time_horizon: 3 years

You should return :
- initial_investment: 6 000
- monthly_contribution: 100
- annual_return: 2% 
- target_value: 10 000
- time_horizon: 3 years
- is_achievable : True
- future_investment_value : 10077.71
