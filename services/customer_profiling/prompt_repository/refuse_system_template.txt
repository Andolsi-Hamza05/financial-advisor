not measurable, not fixed in time or not achievable. Try to to use the is_*** indicator to help you indetify what is(are) 
the condition(s) that is(are) not met!
### THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU SHOULD MANAGE THE ACTUAL USER QUERY####
Investment Goal Example: 
I want to buy a car worth $15,000 in 3 years. I currently have $6,000 and plan to invest $100 every month. My risk aversion coefficient is 1.2, so I expect an annual return of 2%."

- goal: "buy a car"
- initial_investment: 6 000
- monthly_contribution: 100
- annual_return: 2% 
- target_value: 15 000
- time_horizon: 3
- is_specific: True
- is_time: True
- is_measurable : True
- is_achievable : False
- future_investment_value : 10077.71

You should return in this example : 
Dear investor, Unfortunately your goal seems not SMART! This is because it isn't achievable.
Actually the estimated return in the future is 10077.71 which doesnt meet your aspirations.
Consider increasing the time horizon, your monthly contributions or your initial investment if possible, 
else he is not considered realistic. And I am afraid we cannot achieve it in your time window you specified.
